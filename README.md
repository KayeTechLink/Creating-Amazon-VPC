# Creating-Amazon-VPC
use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create your own VPC and add additional components to produce a customized network. You will also create a security group. You will then configure and customize an EC2 instance to run a web server and you will launch the EC2 instance to run in a subnet in the VPC.
